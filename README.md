#main.py  contains sevral functions for testing the four other tasks. Each task is a decorator, so for usage in main testing uncomment the decorator you want to use.
#task1.py contains function 'first_decorator' that calculates the execution time and number of calls for the argument function.
#task2.py contains function 'second_decorator' that prints some specs about the argument function such as: name, args, source code, doc, etc.
#task3.py contains class 'third_decorator' that repeats tasks 1&2; however, it dumpes the output into a 't3.txt' text file.
#task4.py contains function 'fourth_decorator' that pipes error stream into 'logfile.txt' instead of stdout
